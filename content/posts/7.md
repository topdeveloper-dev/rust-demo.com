Next week, on Laravel v9.32.0, we are going to improve the `dd` function output adding the source file/line next to the dumped output.

![DD Example](https://nunomaduro.com/7.1.png)

Some people have asked me how is possible to get the source file/line from the `dd` function call, so in this article, I going to share some details about this pull request: **[github.com/laravel/framework/pull/44211](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/44211)**.

PHP has an insane power function called `debug_backtrace`. This function tells the chain of events that led up to the call to `debug_backtrace`.

So, if our `dd` function originally looked something like this:

```php
function dd($var)
{
    die(var_dump($var));  // dump the output...
}

dd('foo'); // string(3) "foo"
```

We can make use of the `debug_backtrace` to print the source file/line right before dumping the output:

```php
function dd($var)
{
    $trace = debug_backtrace();

    $file = $trace[0]['file']; // The original "file" where the `dd` call was made...
    $line = $trace[0]['line']; // The original "line" where the `dd` call was made...

    echo "// $file:$line\n"; // print the source file:line...

    die(var_dump($var));
}

dd('foo');
// my-app/index.php:14
// string(3) "foo"
```

And that's it! Please refer to [PHP's official documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.debug-backtrace.php) to learn more about this function.
