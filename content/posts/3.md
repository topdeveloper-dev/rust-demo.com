PHP 8.2 is scheduled to be released on the 24th of Nov, 2022. Of course, meanwhile, you may test the new features, syntax changes, and other improvements in your local environment.

In this article, we are going to see how you can start playing with PHP 8.2 RC on your Mac. First, ensure that Brew is installed and up-to-date by running:

```bash
brew update
```

Next, install the repository of formulae that contains PHP 8.2:

```bash
brew tap shivammathur/php
```

Finally, install PHP 8.2 and start using it by running:

```bash
brew install php@8.2
brew link --overwrite --force php@8.2
```

You may now double-check that you are indeed using PHP 8.2 by running:

```
php -v

// PHP 8.2.0-dev (cli) (built: Jun 29 2022 00:22:19) (NTS)
// Copyright (c) The PHP Group
