A good practice in software development is to separate the "secrets" — such as API Tokens — from your source code. Otherwise, people, when visualizing the code could take those secrets, and that represents a security breach.

Today, I was working on setting up a newsletter on my website, that's open source, and had the need `MAILCOACH_API_TOKEN` to interact with the [mailcoach.app](https://mailcoach.app/). Now, because my website is built on Rust, I've used the [dotenv](https://crates.io/crates/dotenv) crate to collect environment variables from a ".env" file.

So, first I've used `cargo` to add the [dotenv](https://crates.io/crates/dotenv) to my project:
```bash
cargo add dotenv
``` 

After, I've created a `.env` file in the root of my project, and inserted the necessary API TOKEN there:
```
MAILCOACH_API_TOKEN=my_api_token_here
```

Next, I've changed the entry point of my Rust program `src/bin/server.rs` to load these environment variables when my program starts:
```rust
use dotenv::dotenv;

fn main() {
    dotenv().ok(); // This line loads the environment variables from the ".env" file.
}
```

Finally, I've adjusted the code to collect the Mailcoach API Token when necessary using the standard library:
```rust
let mailcoach_api_token = std::env::var("MAILCOACH_API_TOKEN").expect("MAILCOACH_API_TOKEN must be set.");
```
