Have you heard about the Null Object Pattern? It's basically a pattern that allows you to replace `null` with real objects — and those objects do nothing. And, in this article, I'm going to show how I've used it with Symfony's Console Output feature.

Yesterday I was working with Symfony's `Symfony\Component\Console\Output\ConsoleOutput` class - and this is a class that allows me to "write" stuff to the console.

Now, in my code, I had a "MyClass" that contains a public "getter" to receive the current Output implementation.

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\ConsoleOutput;

class MyClass
{
    public function __construct(private ?ConsoleOutput $output = null)
    {
        // ..
    }

    public function getOutput(): ?ConsoleOutput
    {
        return $this->output;
    }

    // other things my class do... 
}
```

As you can see, the class above can equally be used without an actually `ConsoleOutput` implementation, and one issue with this is: that the return type of `getOutput` may be `null`. Meaning that consumers of the `getOutput` method will need to use it in the following way:

```php
$output = $object->getOutput();

if (! is_null($output) {
    $output->write('This works because of the if condition...');
}
```

Not always, but usually, if a method is returning more than one type, that's a code smell - specially if is returning a nullable type. Now, there is a simple pattern we can do to improve this. That pattern is called: **Null Object Pattern**.

For my use case, the Null Object Pattern is about having an object that behaves like `ConsoleOutput`, but when you call `write` it should do nothing. In fact, Symfony already ships with a `NullOutput` for this purpose.

To use the `NullOutput` from Symfony, let's first adapt our `MyClass` implementation, so it can receive any kind of `Output`. And for that, we can use the `Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface` interface:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;

class MyClass
{
    public function __construct(private OutputInterface $output)
    {
        // ..
    }

    public function getOutput(): OutputInterface
    {
        return $this->output;
    }

    // ... other things my object do
}
```

Next, when creating an instance of `MyClass`, if we plan to use a `MyClass` object without a real `ConsoleOutput`, we can simply use the `NullOutput` class instead:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\NullOutput;

$output = new NullOutput();
$myObject = new MyClass($output);
```

Finally, because we've used the Null Object Pattern, consumers of `MyClass` no longer need to verify if an `Output` instance exists, before using it:

```diff

$output = $myObject->getOutput();

-if (! is_null($output) {
-    $output->write('This works because of the if condition...');
-}
+$output->write('This always work...');
```
