If you’re a PHP developer, chances are you’ve encountered some of my work before. I’m [Nuno Maduro](https://twitter.com/enunomaduro), the creator and maintainer of popular open source projects such as PEST, PHP Insights, Laravel Zero, Collision, Larastan, Pint, Termwind, and more.

These packages have been downloaded millions of times, and I’m proud to say that each and every one of them helps make the PHP ecosystem a better place. I’m also Laravel core member, and I’ve contributed to many features you’re likely using.

But maintaining all of these projects takes a lot of work, and I’m now dedicating more of my time to them. I’m also developing new projects to make PHP development even more productive and enjoyable — and I can’t do this without your help.

If you’ve ever benefited from one of my projects, I would love your support. You can donate to me via GitHub Sponsors or PayPal. Any amount will help me continue the work I do, and I appreciate it more than you know.
