## Types In Laravel

How do you define and implement a static type system for a dynamic language like PHP and a framework like Laravel, and why would you even care to? In this talk, you will see how type checking can be beneficial even if you don't like types.

Get ready for a live-coding session, where we are going to see how type checking solves real-world problems in PHP and how to introduce it gradually and sustainably in a Laravel application.After this talk, you will be able to use static analysis tools that can spot and fix problems in your source code before it’s run without breaking a sweat.

## Laravel's Artisan Console component

While Laravel is a web framework, many of our interactions with our apps—whether when writing them or when using them—happens on the console. In this talk, we are going to deep dive into one of the most used Laravel components: The Artisan console component.

Get ready for a live-coding session, where we are going to recreate Laravel's Artisan console component from scratch, and demystify all the code and magic behind it.

After this talk, you'll be able to better understand Laravel's Artisan console component and create Artisan commands that people love at warp speed.

## Writing Effective PHP

PHP has evolved massively since its first days, and it's on the road to a full-featured language. However, at the same time, there is a lot of outdated information and libraries with poorly written code.

This talk is about writing PHP Code that is: safe, robust, and maintainable. We are going to cover a set of rules, that if you follow them; they will get you on the habit of writing code well.

## Illuminate Console Applications with Laravel Zero

While it's fun to write little one-off utility scripts, sometimes you need to write real console apps. One that takes arguments and plays nicely with UNIX conventions for input, output or error reporting.

In this talk, we will be using Laravel Zero, a micro-framework that leverages an unofficial and customized version of Laravel to provide an elegant starting point for your console app.
